The same day my plane arrived in Boston, we went to MIT!

I was so excited to read all the flyers that MIT people paste in the cork panels. They look so comp-sciency.

We basically decided to use bikes for moving around Boston, since they cost three times less than the monthly pass for the subway. Was so scared at first, but I got used to it (not better at it).

I purposefully got a little lost through MIT buildings, to get to walk freely around them. I found the STATA building, the one where every person inside knows about AI.

Went to the Health and medicine buidling, where there's the typical USA-college garden in the middle. I felt so happy.

Then, finally arrived to the MIT museum store. This one is not the biggest or main MIT store, but it was the first I found. I ended up buying a lot of MIT merch: 5 t-shirts, 1 sweatshirt and a pair of Einstein socks.

We got kinda hungry at midday, and we found a guy who opened us the aeroastro building's doors to get to a microwave. The common areas look very cozy.

There were many private rooms with blackboards on the walls so I had to take some pictures to avoid forgetting the calm vibe.

Someday I hope I can sit and think about what the boards at MIT say.
