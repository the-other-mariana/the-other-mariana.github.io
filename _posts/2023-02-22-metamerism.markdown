**Metamers** are stimuli with **divergent spectral** power distributions that have **the same color** and luminance. Metamers achieve this effect because each of the human cone photoreceptors responds to the total light across a wide range of wavelengths, weighted according to their spectral sensitivity (Allen et al., 2018).
Metamers are color stimuli which, although they differ in wavelength
composition, look alike in hue, saturation, and brightness to an observer. Metamers look alike because they excite the visual receptor system in exactly the same way, evoking the same *balance of stimulation* across the several receptor types (Cohen et al., 1982).

Thus metamers can serve as substitutes for one another, and in most color-matching operations one achieves metameric matches, not exact matches in stimulus wavelength composition (Cohen et al., 1982). Hence these colors can be described by their three-color metamers, and a generalized procedure of colorstimulus specification by a system of **tristimulus** values becomes possible. Tristimulus values for any stimulus can be calculated from the spectral energy distribution of that stimulus by referring to tabled data from experiments in which wavelength segments have been matched by levels of three chosen primaries.

It is possible to make changes in the intensity and wavelength of light without altering the effective photon flux. This concept is employed by RGB (Red, Green, Blue) displays to recreate realistic images using a spectral composition that is very different from that of the real world. This allows modulation of subconscious/reflex light responses amplitude without changing visual appearance.

Two metameric color stimuli have spectral-power-distribution curves which, in general, intersect at three or more wavelengths within the visible spectrum (Ohta et al., 1977). One of these wavelengths is located in the short-wavelength region, one in the middle-wavelength region, and one in the longwavelength region. Recent work by Thornton puts these wavelengths at 448 $\pm$ 4 nm, 537 $\pm$ 3 nm, and 612 $\pm$ 8 nm, respectively. These regions correspond to the regions in which the “blue,” “green,” and “red” spectral-response functions of our visual system are respectively predominant. We will call the points of intersection the **nodes** of metameric color stimuli. In between the nodes there are the loops.

I found a post in [Pete Shirley's Blog](http://psgraphics.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-blue-dress-illusion.html) titled *The blue dress illusion*, where he explains that the difference in perception regarding the color of the dress is due to the light surrounding it and posts an image he found on Twitter:

This is the same concept illustrated in my copy of *The Structure and Properties of Color Spaces and the Representation of Color Images* by Eric Dubois. This makes me think that exploring the idea of creating a metameric color that gives the illusion of it being not very constrasting to the QR image but being so in numerical terms, not so crazy.
