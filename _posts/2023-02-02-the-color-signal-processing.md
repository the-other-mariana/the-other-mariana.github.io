## Signal Spectrum

The **signal spectrum** describes a **signal's magnitude and phase** characteristics as a **function of frequency**. The system spectrum describes how the system changes signal magnitude and phase as a function of frequency. For example, At the lower frequencies, below around 80 Hz, the magnitude spectrum is 1.0.

**Frequency refers to the number of times an event occurs in a given period of time**. In the context of functions, it refers to the number of times the graph of a function repeats itself in a given amount of time.

The Frequency Domain refers to the analytic space in which mathematical functions or signals are conveyed in terms of frequency, rather than time. For example, where a time-domain graph may display changes over time, a frequency-domain graph displays how much of the signal is present among each given frequency band.

It is possible, however, to convert the information from a time-domain to a frequency-domain. An example of such transformation is a Fourier transform.

- The Fourier transform converts the time function into a set of sine waves that represent different frequencies.
    
- The frequency-domain representation of a signal is known as the "spectrum" of frequency components.

- In the image above, we see the green function in the time domain is the result of the sum of the pink, purple and blue functions, which have 3 different frequencies. The green function has the biggest frequency with the value of the axis point where the pink function is.

The **spectrum of a signal** refers to the distribution of its energy across different frequency components. It provides information about the frequency content of the signal and can be represented as a **plot of the magnitude or power of the frequencies** present in the signal.

> The spectrum can be obtained using techniques such as Fourier transform, short-time Fourier transform, or wavelet transform.

Given that a frequency-domain graph displays **how much of the signal is present among each given frequency** band, then we can say that the **spectrum of a signal** can be represented as a **frequency domain graph of a signal**.
