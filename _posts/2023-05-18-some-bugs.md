## Logo Images with Light Background

Look at the image at the left, and you will notice that when there is supposed to be a dark module ($w_a$ is dark), its background gets no perceivable change. 

![img]({{site.url}}/img/8/light-background-bug.png)

This is due to this part of the code:

```c++

float b = 0.25, a = 0.5, bc = 0.15, ac = 0.4;

// for loops here ...

if (M.at<uchar>(i, j) == 127 && qr.at<uchar>(i, j) == black && binBN.at<uchar>(i, j) == black){
    Light::accumulate_brightness_at(i, j, int(hsvfChannel[2].at<uchar>(i, j) * b), hsvfChannel[2]);
} else if (M.at<uchar>(i, j) == 127 && qr.at<uchar>(i, j) == white && binBN.at<uchar>(i, j) == black){
    Light::accumulate_brightness_at(i, j, int(hsvfChannel[2].at<uchar>(i, j) * a), hsvfChannel[2]);
}

```

where the variable `b = 0.25` is crearly smaller than `a = 0.5`. These two fators are the luminance ratio that is **accumulated** on the luminance value at pixel i,j. In images with natural backgrounds, like the one on the left below, what happens is that, since the color in the pixels is **never at 255**, the dark modules **accumulate less color** than the white modules, giving the impression that they're darker. However, as shown in the first image, when the background tends to be white, the accumulation is never taking any change since dark and white modules both reached already 255. 

The images on the right show the implications of modifying `b` to be `b = -0.25`. The accumulating is now for a darker color since it is now negative. It produces now a useful QR for the white background images, but for the natural background images, the QR is of course useful still, but it gets more noticeable.

What can be done is that maybe use the `Utils::is_logo_image()` function again to only modify the $b$ variable to a negative value if the image is a logo and if the background tends to be white. In the case of natural images, $b$ can stay positive as long as the background is not primarily white. Maybe, then, only convert $b$ to negative whenever the **background is mainly white**?

What was done was precisely to map first all the data modules that have an L channel **mean > 245** and $\sigma$ < 10 and set all the pixels of those modules as a 1 while all the rest are set to 0. The result for the SAP.io logo is the following:
