My name is Mariana Avalos Arce and I majored in Software and Computer Graphics Engineering in Guadalajara, Jalisco, MÃ©xico. My passions are Computer Graphics and Data Science. These two passions involve others, such as Mathematics, Parallelism and Image Processing.

This site has the purpose of structuring the process of the findings I encounter at my job or in my free time, because code that is not documented becomes obsolete in the span of your memory.

Feel free to contact me for any questions regarding software:
